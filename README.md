A lightweight GUI for [magic-wormhole.rs](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole.rs/).

Built with Tauri + React + Typescript

## Current Build

I'm currently working on simplifying this UI as I get closer to the 1.0 release! 

The current goal is to build out the remaining UI to get an ideal width/height of the app to design more user friendly UI.

Looking to push most of the interactable features and error notifications into toast elements for this reason.
